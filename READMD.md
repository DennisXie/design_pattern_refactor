# Practical Task Repository for design patterns

## Task Description
Analyze the given code and prepare refactor and unit tests for each of the task.

## General Task Guidelines

* Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* The task repository may contain one or more practical tasks per topic. You are expected to complete all the tasks.
* While making changes, any files contained inside folder named `thirdparty` should be ignored. **Do not modify thirdparty classes.** These files are meant to provide context for the task and are not part of the task.
* Try to follow object-oriented design, there is no perfect design, it's all about the tradeoffs based on the context.
